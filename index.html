Islam Awareness Week (IAW) is an annual initiative organized by the Muslim Students' Association geared towards breaking stereotypes about Islam and Muslims. It attempts to create a safe and engaging platform where Muslims and people of other faiths or none can interact with each other and engage in fruitful dialogue about matters that concern both. It also provides opportunities for people to meet with Muslim scholars, listen to their lectures, and ask them questions. Additionally, IAW provides Muslim students the opportunity to represent their faith on campus, bring to the forefront challenges facing them specifically, and to speak about what it means for them to be Canadian Muslims. At the end of the day, the IAW team aims to provide an inspirational retreat where one can question their own spirituality and broaden their understanding of Islam.

<br><br>Over the week there will be interactive booths, creative displays, educational literature, and free activities. This year, we decided to put emphasis on engaging the community with activities that occur throughout the day in tandem with our educational booths. Students are free to come discuss any questions they have about Islam, and we will serve food and refreshments to encourage greater participation.

<br><br>Every night a special event will be held. This includes lectures from Muslims of different backgrounds and walks of life and Islamic Scholars. We will be having an arts night, a Multi-Faith panel, as well as a movie screening. We are trying to promote our Muslim students by displaying their artwork and talents. Additionally, we want to connect the community of Muslims and people of other faiths to authentic Islamic scholarship.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">CLEANLINESS IS HALF OF ONE'S FAITH</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
A person’s personality, and attitudes can be seen through their actions of everyday life. The way they interact with others, their speech, the way they walk and talk. It is how people get a sense of who you are, and because this is a reality in society, the prophet Muhammad (pbuh)has ordained us to practice cleanliness of the body and outer shell, as well as to practice cleanliness of the mind, and heart. It is important because it’s only through these avenues can we seek true friendship and love with the creation and more importantly the creator.<br><br>
The Arabic word used in the hadith is “tahara” which actually means “purity”. From the Quran and Sunnah, we can derive and interpret two types of tahara and purity. The first being the (inner tahara) and the second being the (outer tahara).
<BR><BR>
<B>The Inner tahara</B> can be achieved through upholding the pillars of Islam and Faith. To practice the Shahada, Salah(Prayer), Zakat (Charity), Fast, and Pilgrimage, as well as to believe in God, the angels, the prophets, the day of judgement, and predestination. It can be achieved through sincere supplications and following of the prophetic Sunnah. This inner purity can also be achieved through the struggle against one’s own personal desires, and lower self to achieve piety and god consciousness, a process known as the greater Jihad. It can be achieved through the remembrance of god which by itself removes the heart’s spiritual defects such as anger, hatred, fear and loss, antipathy towards death and pride. <B>“He has succeeded who purifies himself, who remembers the name of his Lord and prays” (87: 14-15).</B> When we exalt the greatest and remember who we really are, it builds humbleness, when we pray to God for others, it removes malice, and hatred, and when we remember the day of judgement, it makes us less attached to the world and more inclined to help others. The one who can purify the heart, and reflect this purification in his actions and speech is the one who has succeeded in the eyes of God. <B> “He has succeeded who purifies the soul, and he has failed who corrupts the soul” (91:9-10).</B>
<br><br>
<B>The Outer tahara</B> can be achieved through bodily acts of purification such as Wudu (ablution), Ghusl (full body ablution), wearing clean clothes, perfumes etc.
The perfect teacher Prophet Muhammad use to practice cleanliness, and ordered his companions to follow. He used to take daily baths, wear perfume, and use miswaks, and had worn clothes from the highest to lowest qualities.
The Prophet (saas) said: "Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Putting on beautiful clothes does not mean putting on pride. Pride means denying the truth and looking down on other people." (Sahih Muslim Hadith)
<br><br>
"Our Prophet (saas) used to instruct us to dress as well as we could and to use the most fragrant perfumes we could find." (Bukhari, et-Tarih'ul-Kebir, I, 382, no:1222)
<br><br>
How much Islam emphasizes on cleanliness can be gleamed from the fact that not only we are supposed to keep our bodies, clothes clean and free from offensive smells; we are supposed to stay away from the Mosque if we consume (or use something) which gives out offensive smells.
Jabir b. ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: <B>"He who eats of this (offensive) plant, i.e. garlic, and sometimes he peace be upon him) said: He who eats onion and garlic and leek, should not approach our mosque for the angels are harmed by the same things as the children of Adam. [Muslim]</B>

In conclusion, the practice of inner and outer tahara is what is used to achieve the appreciation of the creation and the creator, and this is why it’s considered half of faith.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">SEEK KNOWLEDGE FOR KNOWLEDGE WILL NOT SEEK FOR YOU</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Islam encourages and rewards the pursuit of knowledge. In fact, healthy questioning in both religion and science is repeatedly encouraged in the Quran, in order to dispel false notions and encourage intellectual growth.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surat Al-Ankabut, verse 20 (29:20): "Travel through the land and observe how He began creation”
                     <br><br>
                    It is not only encouraged to pursue knowledge and understanding, but Allah commands humans to search for how creation was brought forth; as well us pursue what mechanisms allowed for this creation.
                     <br><br>
                    In the Islamic Golden Age from 662 to 1258, Muslim scholars were at the forefront of scientific innovation in fields such as medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. History proves both religion and science are able to interact harmoniously. However, due to language and cultural barriers, many Muslim communities have instead adopted the Christian stance on Darwin’s proposed theory of evolution, mainly due to Islam’s close ties to Christianity.
                     <br><br>
                    Due to a lack of the necessary linguistic and scientific tools, Muslims’ understanding of evolutionary theory has been greatly influenced by our environments and contexts, rather than by the actual scientific facts. The whole science and religion issue is related to the questions of origins. Religious answers are about meaning and the ultimate cause of things. Scientific answers are about immediate evidence and do not address issues of meaning.
                     <br><br>
                    But let’s first look at the language used in scientific literature:
                     <br><br>
                    From the National Academy of Sciences, a fact in science is an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as “true.” Truth in science, however, is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow.
                     <br><br>
                    A Scientific Hypothesis is a tentative statement about the natural world leading to deductions or predictions that can be tested. If the deductions are verified, it becomes more probable that the hypothesis is correct. If the deductions are incorrect, the original hypothesis is abandoned or modified.
                     <br><br>
                    A Law in science is a descriptive generalization about how some aspect of the natural world behaves under specified circumstances (ex. the second law of thermodynamics); whereas vernacular law is pre-scripted, describes or predicts what happens when a situation occurs.
                     <br><br>
                    A Theory, The Goal of Science, in science is a well substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that incorporates facts, laws, and tested hypotheses. Key elements of scientific theories are that they must be falsifiable and internally consistent.
                     <br><br>
                    Evolution has been repeatedly confirmed (via genetic studies, biogeography, direct observation), thus is a fact. But it is also a scientific theory as it is an explanation for the fact of evolution, and provides an explanation for how it occurs.
                     <br><br>
                    Science, and hence evolution, does not directly inform us about questions concerning morality and ethics. Resistance to science or evolution is commonly due to those who hold The Naturalistic Fallacy, which indicates that the way things are, is the way that they should be. Instead, science informs us about the way the natural world is, not about the way the natural world should be. Science has nothing to say about the existence of God or spirituality. Science is not a faith, which is by definition, acceptance in the absence of evidence.
                     <br><br>
                    The Origin of Species (6 Editions), written by Charles Darwin states two major Tenets:
                    1.	All species, living and extinct, have descended without interruption from one or a few original forms of life
                    2.	Theory of natural selection
                     <br><br>
                    The mechanism for inheritance, however, was still unknown to Darwin. Mendel’s “Theory of the Gene” in 1865 described the basis of modern genetics. This allowed for the discovery of genes on chromosomes, mathematical theory of population and quantitative genetics. In the 1950s, it was established that natural selection acts on genetic variation, and this triggered scientists to hypothesize this process of how evolution occurs by relating it to genetic variation. This train of hypothesis is consistent with evolution of taxa at various levels and the fossil record. This was a very important time period in evolutionary biology, where there was an important shift toward understanding the mechanisms of evolution; and it was understood that change in allele frequencies are the ultimate source of evolution.
                    After the discovery of the structure of DNA, DNA sequencing then became practical, followed by molecular development genetics which reveals deep homologies in genes controlling development (molecular homologies describe same genes doing the same thing in different organisms).
                     <br><br>
                    Some Basic Definitions
                    Evolution: Descent with modification; change in population allele frequency
                    Homology:  similarity resulting from common ancestry (the same origin), often despite differences in function
                    Analogy: Similarity in function, but not having the same evolutionary origin; e.g. wings of insect vs. bird wings
                     <br><br>
                    Now let’s look at the various possibilities to explain the history of life:
                    1.	Special Creation: species do not change over time.
                    2.	Evolution: descent with modification (all life forms are related via common ancestry)
                     <br><br>
                    According to scientific evidence, how did species arise on earth? Do other species change over time? Scientific evidence supports different modes of evolution:
                    1.	Microevolution: small evolutionary changes within species or populations (changes in pop allele frequency)
                    2.	Speciation: lineages split and diverge, and an ancestral species can give rise to two or more descendent or daughter species
                    3.	Macroevolution: referring to larger phenotypic changes sufficient to place an organism in a different higher level taxon (eg phylum).
                    Over time, microevolution results in both speciation, as well as macroevolutionary differences.
                     <br><br>
                    The Quran is very clear in its support that humans came from lower beings and that creation had a process involving diverse successive stages:
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Fatir, verse 1 (35:1): [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
                     <br><br>
                    Allah originates creation and increases the complexity in creation, or the evolution of life. Following this verse, Allah continues to speak on human creation and the various natural phenomena around us. There is a correlation between this increase in complexity and human creation, evident by the placement of these verses. Life on earth originated and gained complexity.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Nuh, verse 14 (71:14): While He has created you in stages?
                     <br><br>
                    While one can interpret these verses in different ways, both on the stages of creation from germinal to embryonic to fetal stage; as well as referencing the creation of all humanity (plural “you” is used) and the evolutionary stages accompanying this creation.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surat An-Nur, verse 45 (24:45): “Allah has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.”
                     <br><br>
                    All living creation began with water – the first living organisms on Earth were single-celled microorganisms that were only able to survive due to incorporation of water in it’s cellular processes.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surat Al-An’am, verse 2 (6:2): “It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified time [known] to Him; then [still] you are in dispute.”
                     <br><br>
                    Allah’s creation of life involved clay (combination of water and earth soil), and allowed for this initial creation to evolve before a specific time that He determined creation was ready to receive scripture.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Nuh, verse 17 (71:17): “And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth.”
                     <br><br>
                    Again, this progressive nature is expressed to indicate that organisms grew, developed and changed from the Earth in a continuous way.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah At-Taghabun, verse 3 (64:3): “He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms; and to Him is the [final] destination.”
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Ghafur, verse 64 (40:64): “It is Allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things”
                     <br><br>
                    The argument that humans were created in a perfect, yet complex design at once is a common one. In these verses, however, we find that the human form has gone through a process of betterment, through Allah’s will, and improved and perfected to Allah’s liking.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Hud, verse 61: “He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it”
                     <br><br>
                    Humans were produced from the Earth, unlike the views of modern creationists that state God molded us with his hands in heaven.
                     <br><br>
                    In Surah Al’An’am, verse 133: “If He wills, he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people.”
                     <br><br>
                    There is constant repetition within the Quran that humans are descendants of another people, and that the humans existing can also be replaced with another generation. Of the many verses, this concept of succession and descending from a different type of people can be interpreted to support the idea that humans evolved from another creature and succeeded.

                  <p class="text-left">
                    This teaching seems to be straightforward by serving as a reminder for husbands to treat their wives well and exemplifying the priority of giving women their rights while also dignifying them. The full statement in English translation is, “ Among the Muslims the most perfect, as regards to his faith, is the one whose character is excellent, and the best among you are those who are the best to his wife.” This shows the importance as stated in the earlier section, for husbands to not forget to treat their wives with the utmost respect no matter who they are outside of the family. Though they may be highly praised outside of the family for having good character and treating others well, they also need to be aware that being a good, pious Muslim also includes being the best to their wives. The best example that Muslims follow is the Prophet (peace be upon him). Though there were disagreements in the marriages (as with any marriage), the wives of the Prophet found that his behaviour towards them was of the utmost respect. Truthfully, with other leaders and public figures, you sometimes find that their level of treatment with towards their wives pale in comparison to the level of treatment they have towards the community. Some leaders and figures feel the pressure of the responsibility to their community more so than to their wives, but in this teaching, the treatment of their wives indicates a very high standard that husbands need to meet if they are to be considered the best of people.

                  <p>
                    In Islam, one of the holiest places you can be is the Mosque (place of worship for Muslims). The Mosque is considered the home of God and we must treat it that way. One should lower their voices and refrain from disturbing others in the Mosque and leave no mess behind. Maintaining the cleanliness of a Mosque is extremely important as well an ensuring it is always welcoming and fragrant to those who enter. The Mosque deserves these special actions primarily because it is a place of worship. In an authentic hadith, the prophet Muhammad PBUH said, “The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is” (Muslim). Muslims are told that the entire earth is a place of worship for them, so naturally it deserves the same respect. The streets we wander should be kept clean, the environment green, and our surroundings pure. Islam stands with those who protect the environment and want to see a greener sustainable future for all.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">MEN WEAR HIJABS TOO</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Hijab in Arabic means veil or barrier. In Islam, it refers to the inner and outer covering or practices that guards one’s modesty. Though the discussion of hijab has been disproportionately surrounded around the practices that women need to follow with the most obvious being the scarf, the Qu’ran’s decree of men observing hijab comes first. The verse reads, “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do” 24:30.”  Among the many practices that are encompassed in the term, hijab, the number one practice mentioned in the Qur’an is for men to lower their gaze which puts the responsibility on the men to ensure that they’re modesty is protected. This is in contradiction to rape culture which blames women for being promiscuous and fails to address the responsibility of men to combat this toxic culture.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of covering externally, men are obligated to cover from the naval (belly button) to the knee and avoid wearing skin-tight clothing. Though telling someone to dress and act modestly can seem ambiguous and vague, Muslims need to keep in mind what the overall big picture and goal of hijab is. The emphasis on modesty in Islam is to protect Muslims from falling into impure characteristics, such as arrogance and boastfulness, that may arise when one is not diligent with observing hijab.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">GIVE YOUR BODY THE RIGHT IT DESERVES</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    The idea of the role our bodies take in our lives vary from person to person, religious or non-religious. For example, if someone is under extreme stress whether it is caused by work, school, family or friends, we tend to push the priority of taking care of our bodies further down the list and sometimes we end up sick, injured or just burned-out. Sleep in this case is one of the first things to go. Islam teachings state that we need to find a balance between fulfilling other duties and rights put on us such us our rights to God, family, friends and so on. One example is that during Ramadan, if a Muslim feels too sick to fast, then they are not obligated to fast on that particular day but can make it up another day when they have recovered after the month is over. In this case, a Muslim is balancing the rights to God and the rights of their body and as you can see in this example, the rights of God are put secondary to the rights of the body. Though this seems to be blasphemous, Muslims make sense of the situation by coming to the conclusion that God is demonstrating his mercy towards us since He does not needs His rights fulfilled because God is self-sufficient with or without us. In contrast, our bodies needs its rights fulfilled in order to keep going.
                    <br><br>
                    With that being said, Muslims rationalize that the reason drinking, smoking or eating non-halal meat are forbidden (after the primary reason that God prohibited it), is that it harms the body more than benefiting it. One could argue that there are many more actions someone could do to harm their body that are not explicitly forbidden in Islam so how does one go about navigating this situation? As with any principle stated in the religion, Muslims need to understand the big picture (in this case fulfilling the rights of they body) and practice the religion accordingly keeping in mind that God is always watching.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">HUMILITY SHOULD GROW WITH KNOWLEDGE</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Muslims believe that knowledge is a privilege because one never really “has” knowledge because Allah (God) is the one who owns everything He created which includes knowledge. Knowledge thus is something that Allah gives to us through love and mercy. For this reason, certain etiquette should be observed when attaining knowledge which includes showing teachers and people of knowledge the utmost respect and to purify oneself externally and internally by avoiding gossip, removing envy and grudges from the metaphorical heart and physically washing the body. Since knowledge is held in this high regard, then one should understand that the knowledge they seemingly attain is first and foremost a privilege and blessing given by Allah and other factors that allowed one to attain knowledge, like one’s own hard work and determination, is always second to the first factor. The more knowledge one is entrusted with, the more privileged and blessed they are because of Allah and the more responsibility they have to use that knowledge wisely. One should therefore be humbled by the opportunity to attain any sort of knowledge because the knowledge they are seeking is a gift from God not a right.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">SMILING IS AN ACT OF CHARITY</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Muslims believe that Islam has been made easy for them to follow and the simple act of smiling as a form of charity is an example of this ease and allows for an opportunity for those with less wealth to give to charity.

  The belief of the ease in the teachings of Islam may seem like a surprise because of the seemingly large amount of rules that a Muslim has to follow. However, a Muslim should believe that these rules are actually supposed to make one’s life easier, as they only have to follow the rules set out by God and trust that He will handle the rest (but only if a Muslim tries their best to better their lives within the rules assigned).

  Now in regards to the quote mentioned before, charity is traditionally thought of as giving something of value to someone else, which usually means money. However, not everyone has excess money to give to charity. With this quote, a small act such as smiling, can be done by just about everyone which shows the ease and inclusivity of the religion.

  As Muslims, it is imperative that we spread the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). One of these teachings has to do with spreading positivity as one goes about their life. With reference to this particular phrase, we are encouraged to smile and one of the incentives of doing so is that it counts as a form of charity. There are multiple references for this phrase, a few of which are listed below:

  "Your smiling in the face of your brother is charity, commanding good and forbidding evil is charity, your giving directions to a man lost in the land is charity for you. Your seeing for a man with bad sight is a charity for you, your removal of a rock, a thorn or a bone from the road is charity for you. Your pouring what remains from your bucket into the bucket of your brother is charity for you." (Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1956: Book 27, Hadith 62)

                  <p class="text-left">
                    This quote seems to contradict itself. How is saying you don’t know something an indicator of the amount of knowledge you know? But half of knowledge - now that’s absurdity. However, one needs to take a look into how a Muslim looks at knowledge. A famous Muslim scholar by the name of Sufyan ath-Thawri, stated that, “Knowledge comes in three hand spans: the first breeds ignorance, the second breeds humility, and in the third you realize you know nothing.” The third hand-span is the most highly regarded of the three and is considered the third stage to one that is seeking knowledge. Therefore, when the quote mentions that “half of knowledge is to say I don’t know” then that person has reached a point when they realize that they actually know nothing in relation to Allah (God) who knows everything.
<BR><BR>
Further, the wisdom of humbly replying to a question with “I don’t know” shows your understanding that the concept of knowledge is more profound than the answer you might give to the question posed. Replying with “I don’t know” shows an understanding that spreading accurate knowledge is the priority in any given situation and not the reputation of the person being asked. Once one understands the enormity of the responsibility of spreading accurate knowledge, then they have already done half the work of attaining knowledge by building a solid foundation to work from.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">A MAN IS NOT A BELIEVER WHO FILLS HIS STOMACH WHILE HIS NEIGHBOR IS HUNGRY</h2>
                  <p class="text-left">
                    The noble Quran mentions that all of humanity are descendants of Adam and Eve, and as a result brothers and sisters to each other. Allah (swt) takes notice of this concept, and even honors it, <B>“O’ Humanity! Without doubt We have created you from a male and a female and have made you into various nations and tribes, so that you may come to know and understand one another….” (49:13). </B>To understand and know one another truly comes from the inner desire to care, and show empathy to one another. This is something emphasized in Islam, wither the person is halfway across the world or right beside you. The Prophet of Islam (pbuh) taught that because those around you are indeed your family, you have an obligation to support, help, and desire for them what you’d desire for yourself. The Prophet (pbuh) said, <B>“None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” (narrated by both al Bukhari and Muslim).</B>
This being a central tenant in Islam is why the Prophet (pbuh) gave extreme attention to the matter of neighbors, and their rights. The concern of neighbors implicates not only the provisions of food for them, but to ensure the basic necessities, it means to share happiness and sorrow with another, and to guarantee their safety from you emotionally, mentally and physically. The neighbors within Islam regardless of being believers or not indeed have a special rank within the religion. The idea is that everyone has neighbors, and so if each person can treat their neighbors through the spirit of Islam, it would resolve a plethora of problems in the world. If everyone can ensure the safety of those around them, and help and provide for another, the only possible results are emotions of love instilled inside the hearts of people for the people around them. This creates the peaceful ideal community to which the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) gave us the tools to create.
<br><br>
The following are simple advices from the prophet of God about treating neighbors:
<B>Eight hadiths on neighbors</B>
1) <B>Prohibition of Harming Neighbors:</B> The Prophet, (Peace and blessings be upon him) said: "By Allah, he is not a believer! By Allah, he is not a believer! By Allah, he is not a believer.’’ It was asked, "Who is that, O Messenger of Allah?’’ He said, "One whose neighbor does not feel safe from his evil" (Sahih Bukhari).
 <br><br>
2) <B>Recommendation to treat neighbor well:</B> The Messenger of Allah, (Peace and blessings be upon him), said: "Jibril kept recommending me to treat my neighbour well until I thought that he would tell me to make him one of my heirs" (Bukhari: 6014).
 <br><br>
3) <B>Caring for your neighbors:</B> Abu Dharr, May Allah be pleased with him, reported: The Messenger of Allah, (Peace and blessings be upon him), commanded me thus, "O Abu Dharr! Whenever you prepare a broth, put plenty of water in it, and give some of it to your neighbors" (Sahih Muslim).
 <br><br>
4) <B>Co-operation with your neighbors:</B> Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the messenger of Allah, (Peace and blessings be upon him), said: "No-one should prevent his neighbour from fixing a wooden peg in his wall." Abu Huraira said (to his companions), "Why do I find you averse to it? By Allah, I certainly will narrate it to you" (Sahih Bukhari),
 <br><br>
5) <B>Do not eat your full while your neighbour is hungry:</B> The Messenger of Allah, (Peace and blessings be upon him) says:" He is not a believer who eats his fill whilst his neighbour beside him goes hungry" (Bukhari).
 <br><br>
6) <B>Never scorn your neighbor’s gift:</B> Sahih Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet, (Peace and blessings be upon him), used to say: "O Muslim women! No one should scorn the gift of a neighbour, even if it is (only) a sheep’s foot" (Bukhari: 6017).
 <br><br>
7) <B>Harming a neighbour may lead to Hell-fire:</B> Abu Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him reported: A man asked, "O Messenger of Allah! There is a woman who prays, gives charity and fasts a great deal, but she harms her neighbors with her speech (by insulting them)" He said: "She will go to hell". The man said: "O messenger of Allah! There is (another) woman who is well-known for how little she fasts and prays, but she gives charity from the dried yoghurt she makes and she does not harm her neighbors". He said: "She will go to paradise" (Ahmad, vol. 4, p. 166, Ibn Hibban, hadith no. 2054).
 <br><br>
8) <B>Tolerance when treating neighbors:</B> Mutarrif said: "I heard that you (he means Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him) have said that the Prophet, (Peace and blessings be upon him), said: "Allah loves three and hates three.’"
Abu Dharr said, "I do not think that I would tell lies about the Messenger of Allah."
Mutarrif said, "Then who are the three whom Allah loves?" Abu Dharr (quoting the Prophet, (Peace and blessings be upon him)) said: "A man who fights for the sake of Allah, with perseverance and hoping for reward from Him, and fights until he is killed, and you find this in the Book of Allah.’ Then he recited: “Truly Allah loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.” [al-Saff 61:4] Mutarrif asked, “Then who?”
He said, “A man who has a bad neighbour who annoys and disturbs him, but he bears it with patience and forbearance until Allah ends the matter either during his lifetime or upon the death of either of them.”

To follow these guidelines can only lead to peace within all communities, which in fact is the embodiment of Islam.

                  <p class="text-left">
                    Did you know that Islam teaches people to respect the environment and earth around them? In an authentic hadith (tradition/teaching/word of the prophet Muhammad PBUH) it is narrated that the prophet Muhammad PBUH said, "There is none amongst the Muslims who plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it, but is regarded as a charitable gift for him."‏ (Bukhari). In Islam, giving charity is one of the greatest forms of worshipping and acts of good that a person can do. Planting a tree provides shelter and food for animals and have a positive effect on the air and quality of the environment around us. Every single positive effect that this tree has on the living beings around it is because of the planter, so why would it not be a noble act? Even when one has left this world, the trees left behind will continue to bless them for the act of charity they have done. Earth itself is a gift from God and who else other than us to take care of it and keep it clean? These among others are the reasons Muslims are encouraged to give the lasting charity by planting a tree. And God loves those who help others.

                  <p class="text-left">
                    In Islam God is the most compassionate, and most merciful. He constantly gives his creation the opportunity to embody those quality in their lives for their own betterment and the betterment of society. So even something as small as removing something harmful from a path is an act of charity, and something that is deserving of a reward in the eyes of almighty Allah (swt).

<BR><BR><BR><b>
“On the authority of Abu Huraira who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him said), “Every small bone of everyone has upon it a charitable act for everyday upon which the sun rises. Bringing about justice between two is an act of charity. Helping a man get on his mount, lifting him onto it or helping him put his belongings onto it, is a charitable act. A good word is a charitable act. Every step you take toward the prayer is a charitable act. And removing a harmful thing from the path is a charitable act.” (Recorded in al-Bukhari and Muslim)
<BR><BR></b>
It is such a small act of kindness, but holds such huge magnitude in the domain of God, so much that it’s considered charity. In another hadith the prophet of God has said that removing something from the road is even an act of worship for it is a branch of faith!
<BR><BR><b>
“Faith is seventy- or sixty- some odd branches. The most virtuous of them is the statement, ‘There is none worthy of worship but Allah.’ And the lowest of them is removing something harmful from the path. And hayaa (modesty) is part of faith.” (Recorded in Muslim)
<BR><BR></b>
If everyone was to adopt this concept we’d have the cleanest streets in the world. Another wisdom behind this saying of the prophet (pbuh) is just to show to humanity how really loving and merciful their Lord can be. The fact that such a small act can be considered worship, and charity. It truly is a reflection of the Allah(swt) and his amazing qualities.
